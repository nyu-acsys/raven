  /*
    There used to be a bug in the `rewrite_own_expr_4_arg` rewriter which 
    translates 4-arg own chunks into uniform 3-arg own chunks.
    
    The name for the Frac module generated to rewrite the inhale expression is:
      $Program.M.AN.Frac$Fld-Ref-.T
    
    The name that is actually generated during the `rewrite_frac_field_types` rewrite is:
      $Program.A.Frac$Fld-$Program_A_Tp_T-.T
  */


  /*
    This bug was fixed in the following commit:
      b0f5e2d7a172fe321c677dcbad14eb340563097b
    
    Earlier, `rewrite_frac_field_types` was using field types to generate frac module name. Switched to using field_name.
