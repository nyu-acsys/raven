All notable changes to this project will be docmented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added cmpxchg atomic operation.

### Changed

- Finished implementation of rdcss;
- Added expr_ext_rewrite_types, stmt_ext_rewrite_types to ExtAPI.
- Added parser support for auCommit resources; enable 'helping'
- Expanded definition of "word-sized" types to more flexible types such as algebraic sums of base types.
- Overhauled extensions to follow namespace-style convention.
- Added support for helping by allowing auPred resources to refer to another proc; overhauling parser, type-checking and rewriting.
- Updated syntax so that commitAU always requires at least two argument: token and a tuple of return values (if function returns nothing then it should be ()); and an optional third argument which is a tuple of the callable args (which goes as the middle argument). This optional argument becomes required if the token refers to a different procedure.
